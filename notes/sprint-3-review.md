# Sprint 3 Review

**What is done?**
- User can go to a separate html to chat with other users.
- Created structure for user to move to different rooms.

**What has slipped?**
- Have not created rooms that allow users to join separate chats
- The chat is very basic and ugly. Additionally, users have to go to a separate page in order to use the chat.
- The implmentation of the socket is not well understood. 
- Did not merge all of the branches we needed to before tagging the product.
- The stages of the branches are in question. Some are behind develop and some are ahead. 

**What feedback does your group have on delivered work?**
- The deliverable left a lot to be desired.
- There was not enough effort put into this sprint and delivering a quality product. 
- There must be a desire to work on the product. The main functionality will never be good if left in it's current state.
