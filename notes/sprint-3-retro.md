Sprint 3 Retrospective Notes

**What should we keep doing?**

**What should we stop doing?**
- Stop waiting until the last two days to start working on the project.
- Submitting gits through the UI.
- Worrying about other classes during class time. 

**What should we start doing?**
- Start learning. Learn how to use the command line. Learn how the technologies interact to make a functioning app.
- Researching the functions we want to add to the chat and how.
- Start working on the sprint immediately after the sprint starts. Not waiting until the last two days to start.
- Have meaningful discussion during class about how to approach the sprint and problems.
- Start simple. None of us have experience with these technologies. We have to be smart about how we approach our tasks. 
- Communicating!!!
- Merging branches on time. There is not enough time to merge everything at the end and have a working product.
